# malware_detection

This project employs supervised machine learning to detect malware within computer systems, utilizing primary data sources. It adopts dynamic malware analysis by executing suspicious code within a controlled environment, specifically the Flare VM on Windows 10 distribution. Log files are generated by running both malware and benign software on the Flare VM. Data extraction is accomplished through the application of an NLP technique known as 'bag of words,' followed by labeling. Subsequently, the project proceeds to model training and evaluation, employing four different algorithms: RandomForest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and SVM.
